<b>BC</b> (version 1.07.1) (see the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/bc.html">manual</a>)  is a programming language that supports arbitrary precision integer arithmetic calculations with interactive execution of statements. 
 It is an idiosyncratic programming language which closely resembles parts
 of the C language. While it is somewhat slow for some purposes (all code is
 executed as it is read), the author has found <strong>bc</strong> very useful in
 teaching and research.  The code is very easy to read and students can see
 directly how an algorithm has been implemented. It is also useful as a template
 for harder-to-write, but faster C code.<p>
Bugs and idiosyncrasies: 
<ol>
<li> When using the if-else construction, insert a "<tt>\</tt>", as follows:
<pre>
          if(expression){statement1}\
          else{ statement2}
</pre>
Alternatively, as pointed out by <a href="http://www.instantlogic.net/">Anton Stiglic</a>, use the construction
<pre>
          if(expression){
               statement1
          }else{
               statement2
          }
</pre>
<li>The <tt>continue</tt> statement only works for <tt>for</tt> loops.
<li>Alan Offer pointed out that f(*b[]) changes the array values.
<li>January 27, 2020.  I found that the BC 1.06.95 command<p>

<tt>bc bigu stoltvialmm squareroot</tt><p>

produced an error message:<p>

<tt>squareroot 667: Assignment of a void expression</tt><p>

However on changing the order of files to<p>

<tt>bc squareroot bigu stoltvialmm</tt><p>

there was no problem!  This phenomenon is not present in bc 1.07.1.<p>

Also see <a href="http://www.pixelbeat.org/programming/oss_bug_flow.html">
P&aacute;draig Brady's example</a>.
