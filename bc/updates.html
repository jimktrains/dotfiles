 but this will soon be reinstated.
<li>26th November 2010. Forgot to add <tt>gcd()</tt> and <tt>gcd3()</tt> to the new version of <strong>nscf_pell</strong>.
<li>25th November 2010. Replaced <strong>nscf_pell</strong>. The new version uses a test for NSCF reduced which is better than the actual definition, which was used in the original program.
<li>25th November 2010.  <a href="http://www.gladman.me.uk/">Brian Gladman</a> has pointed out that in <strong>nscf_pell</strong>, inside the function nscf_pqa(), the line  d=d*(t*t) should be outside the braces.  This error was also present in <strong>nipell</strong>.
<li>2nd November 2010.  In <strong>ocf</strong>, fixed a bug in <tt>ocf_pqd1</tt>, where I should have tested if(pk==3 && qk==3 && d==5) instead of if(pk==3 && qk==3).  Also updated the ocf file by adding the function <tt>ocf_pqd2</tt>, which replaces <tt>ocf_pqd1</tt>.
<li>4th September 2010. Improved the logic in <strong>carmichael</strong>.
<li>27th August 2010.  Altered the printing in <strong>carmichael</strong>.  It now tests Carmichael's conjecture.

<li>20th November 2009.  Added <strong>ocf</strong>.
<li>29th March 2009. Added <strong>equivalent</strong>.

<li>10th January 2008. Added  <tt>nicf_pqa0(d,t,p,q,e)</tt> to <b>nipell</b>.  Bugs fixed subsequently.
<li>8th January 2008. I now convert the input surd (u +t&radic;d)/v to <em>standard form</em> in files <b>nipell</b> and <b>nscf_pell</b>. ie.  (U +&radic;D)/V, where gcd(U, V, (D - U<sup>2</sup>)/V) = 1.  <br>
<!--Also added <tt>nicf_pqa0(d,t,p,q,e) to nipell.  This gives the nearest integer cfrac of Perron's book.-->
<li>1st December 2007. Removed auto variables t1 and t2 in nscf_pell(d,e). Apparently 26 is the maximum number of auto variables allowed in a BC function!  Also tightened the logic in the definition of the partial numerators a[i].
<li>15th November 2007. Added gcd3(a,b,c).
<li>Altered the code for the nearest square algorithm so as to agree with lines 5-6, page 25, of the A.A.K. Ayyangar paper, when |Q'| = |Q"|.
<li>2nd November 2007. Added <tt>nscf_pqa(d,t,p,q,e)</tt> to <b>nscf_pell</b>.
<li>1st November 2007.Made some small improvements and corrections (regarding the period length) to <b>nscf_pell</b> and <b>nipell</b>.
<li>31st October 2007. Added <b>nscf_pell</b>.
<li>22nd October 2007. Added <tt>nicf_pqa(d,t,u,v,e)</tt> to <b>nipell</b>.
<li>18th October 2007. Added <tt>nicf(m,n)</tt> to <b>lra</b>.
<li>12th October 2007. Corrected output about period in <b>nipell</b>.

<li>15th November 2006. Small improvement to <b>reducepos</b>.
<li>13th June 2006. Fixed a serious error in <b>nprimeap</b>.
<li>8th August 2004. Added <tt>binary</tt> to <strong>patz</strong>.
<li>4th August 2004. Added <tt>quadratic</tt> to <strong>squareroot</strong>.
<li>16th July 2004. Added <strong>patz</strong>.
<li>14th July 2004. <strong>squareroot</strong> continues to haunt me. 
<ul>
<li>I fixed a bug in relation to solving x<sup>2</sup> <img src="../gifs/equiv.gif"> 0 (mod 2). 
<li>Also had an incorrect construction for extending the solutions to original modulus n, so as to list them in the form &plusmn;P (mod n), with 0 &le; P &le; n/2.
<li>Replaced <tt>if(qglobal[i]==2 &amp;&amp; number==1)</tt> by <tt>if(number==1)</tt>. This error was giving the wrong answer in x<sup>2</sup> <img src="../gifs/equiv.gif"> 0 (mod 6).                                       
</ul>
<li>14th May 2004. Added <strong>forster_log</strong>.
<li>13th May 2004. Noticed that I'd omitted a restriction that in <strong>discrete_log</strong>, we must have  p &lt; 2<sup>32</sup>-2<sup>16</sup> in order to satisy BC array upper bound length of 2<sup>16</sup>-1.
<li>27th April 2004. Fixed a small global variable problem arising when calculating Ramanujan's tau function tau_composite(n). Having factored n and obtained global variables representing the prime factors q[i] and their exponents k[i], I inadvertently changed these on subsequent factorisations involved in calculating tau(q[i]).
<li>21st April 2004. Added <tt>sigmak(k,n)</tt> and <tt>tau</tt> to <strong>phi</strong>.
<li>15th April 2004. Added <strong>squareroot</strong>, which is a cleaner version of <strong>sqroot</strong>. The new program contains <tt>cornacchia(a,b,m)</tt>.

<li>17th March 2004. Changed name of <strong>2adic</strong> to <strong>p-adic</strong>. Also added <tt>padic(a,p,n)</tt>.
<li>10th March 2004. Added <strong>2adic</strong>.
<li>27th February 2004. Added <strong>factorial</strong>.
<li>26th February 2004. Added <strong>binomial</strong>.
<li>22nd May 2003. Added <strong>unimodular</strong>.
<li>15th May 2003. Added the solution of equations x<sup>2</sup>-d*y<sup>2</sup>=&plusmn;3 and &plusmn;4 to <strong>pell</strong>.
<li>14th May 2003. Added <tt>table(m,n)</tt> to <strong>classnopos</strong>.
<li>14th May 2003. Added <tt>table(m,n)</tt> to <strong>classnoneg</strong>.
<li>12th May 2003. Fixed a small error in the function <tt>period</tt>. It was supposed to be returning the cycle-length, not <tt>global_count</tt>!
<li>12th May 2003. Added <tt>class_number0(d)</tt> to <strong>classnopos</strong>.
<li>7th May 2003. Fixed an error on lines 58-60 of <strong>classnoneg</strong>.

<li>19th February 2003. Added program <strong>john</strong>.
<li>23rd September 2002. Fixed errors on lines 104 and 112 of <b>lagrange</b>, where I had 2 instead of n.
<li>18th September 2002. <b>lagrange</b> now needs <b>sturm</b>. <tt>gcdpi</tt> and <tt>sturm</tt> now have an extra parameter e, where e=0 suppresses printing. <tt>lagrange</tt> has also been tightened up. We now check that the input polynomial satisfies the appropriate restrictions. Also the program now handles the case when the root above 1 is in fact rational.
<li>16th September 2002. Improved <tt>printp</tt> in <strong>sturm</strong>.
<li>15th September 2002. Added <strong>sturm</strong>.

<li>14th June 2002. Added another log program - <strong>log2</strong>.
<li>8th March 2002. I removed the line <tt>j=2</tt> from <tt>gcd1</tt> in <strong>gcd</strong> and <strong>sqroot</strong>. (Kindly pointed out by Kjell Wooding.)
<li>10th August 2001. I reinstated <strong>log1</strong>.
<li>24th July 2001. I replaced the above <strong>log</strong> program by the one that is currently in my manuscript <a href="../../pdfs/log.pdf">log.pdf</a>. 
<li>14th June 2001. Today I noticed problems with degenerate cases arising from small r in my <tt>log</tt> algorithm.
<li>23rd February 2001. Added <strong>tomas2</strong>.
<li>13th February 2001. Added <strong>tomas1</strong>.
<li>20th October 2000. Altered <tt>unit</tt> so that when d=5 it returned the correct answer.

<li>1st May 2000. Corrected printing of output in <strong>thue</strong>: changed s to t at appropriate places.
<li>26th April 2000. <strong>surd</strong> now prints P<sub>n</sub> and Q<sub>n</sub>, where the nth complete quotient is (P<sub>n</sub>+sqrt(d))/Q<sub>n</sub>.
<li>11th April 2000. Realised <strong>sqroot</strong> still had some bugs.  Hopefully these are now fixed.
<li>7th April 2000. Replaced <strong>sqroot</strong> by an improved version which solves the general congruence x<sup>2</sup><img src="../gifs/equiv.gif">d (mod n). Any bug reports are gratefully received.
<li>6th April 2000. Realised <strong>sqroot</strong> has some bugs. 
<li>5th April 2000. Changed <tt>thue(d,p)</tt> to  <tt>thue(d,u,p)</tt>.
<li>4th April 2000.  Added <strong>sqroot</strong>. This finds all solutions of x<sup>2</sup><img src="../gifs/equiv.gif">d (mod n) where gcd(d,n)=1. 
<li>3rd April 2000. Changed name of <tt>chineseab()</tt> to <tt>chineseb()</tt>. Rewrote <tt>chinesea()</tt> and <tt>chineseb()</tt>.
<li>2nd April 2000. Added printing of partial quotients and truncated decimal expansion to <strong>log</strong>. Removed printing of A[i].
Also added <strong>thue</strong>. Here d>1, is not a square, p an odd prime not dividing d-1. Then <tt>thue(d,p)</tt> finds x,y such that x<sup>2</sup>-dy<sup>2</sup>=kp, with small k. 
<li>1st April 2000. <strong>jacobi</strong> now does not need <strong>gcd</strong> and is a stand-alone program.<br>
<li>28th March 2000. Discovered that the old version of <strong>log</strong> did not always give the correct partial quotients. The current version seems to be more reliable. Type <tt>log(3,2,2,10,0)</tt> to output roughly 20 partial quotients of log<sub>2</sub>(3), whereas typing <tt>log(3,2,2,10,1)</tt> prints the A[i] of algorithm 1 of manuscript <a href="../../pdfs/log.pdf">log.pdf</a>. The number of partial quotients is returned in both cases.
<li>13th March 2000. Made some improvements to the output of <strong>log</strong>.
<li>4th March 2000. Added <strong>rootd_modn</strong>. This is a crude program for solving x<sup>2</sup><img src="../gifs/equiv.gif">d (mod n) with 0 &le; x &le; n/2 for small n.
<li>Added <strong>log</strong>. This is a discrete variant of Shank's algorithm for computing the simple continued fraction for log<sub>b</sub>n, (Math. Tables and Aids to Computation. 8, 1954, 60-64), originally written by Alan Offer and recently improved by vacation scholar Sean Seefried and myself. It should currently be treated with caution. For while we believe that <tt>log(n,b,z,e)</tt> computes approximately 2z partial quotients of log<sub>b</sub>n, we cannot guarantee the correctness of output!.
<li> <strong>lagrange</strong> was improved by Sean Seefried, using the binary search method in page 261 of <em>Number Theory with Computer Applications</em>, by R. Kumanduri and C. Romero, 17th December 1999.
<li> Improved the <strong>euclid</strong> program. It now prints the s[k] and t[k] associated with Euclid's algorithm.
<li> Forgot to test possibility n<sub>p</sub>=2 in <tt>leastqnr(p)</tt>. Fixed 28th September 1999. 
<li> Cosmetic alterations to the <strong>tonelli</strong> program, 24th August 1999.
<li> Added <strong>leastqnr</strong>, 13th August 1999.
Also removed dependence of <strong>proth</strong> on <strong>phi</strong> and <strong>gcd</strong>.<br>
<li> Removed dependence of <strong>lucas</strong> on <strong>phi</strong>.<br>
<li> Tightened up the <strong>discrete_log</strong> program, 11th August 1999.
<li> Added the <strong>discrete_log</strong> program, 12th July 1999.
<li> Added the <strong>tonelli</strong> program, 29th June 1999.
<li> Fixed bug in <strong>gcd</strong> in lcma(m[ ],n) (should have returned b[n-1], not b[n]) 11th November 1998.
<li> Added some functions to <strong>phi</strong> that are normally in <strong>gcd</strong>, 9th October 1998.
<li> Added <strong>recursion</strong>, 3rd May 1998.
<li> Added the <strong>lupei</strong> program. 24th March 1998.
